The data provided in this folder are related to the project "A rolling horizon heuristic approach for a multi-stage stochastic waste collection problem" (Andrea Spinelli, Francesca Maggioni, Tânia Rodrigues Pereira Ramos, Ana Paula Barbosa-Póvoa, Daniele Vigo).

Specifically, we provide the following files:
  - Distance_matrix_50bins.csv contains the distances between each location
  - Filling_level.csv contains, for each bin and for each collection day, the filling level recorded by the waste collector of _ERSUC - Resíduos Sólidos do Centro, S.A._
